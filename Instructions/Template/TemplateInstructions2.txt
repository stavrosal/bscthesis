We want to simulate a system of FiniteStateMachines.
There are a lot of FSMs where each one performs an operation.
After a machine starts (start()), it runs until a finish 
condition is met (isFinished()), and the finish method 
is called (finish()). For now, our system has two machines:
A DivisibleNumbersMachine, where it calculates all numbers 
divisible by 4 up to a threshold (specified by the user)
and a PushDownAutomaton, where it calculates the sum of
numbers up to a threshold (specified by the user). The 
PushDown Machine has an ArrayList<Integer> as a stack.
