We wish to model a system of a clothing shop.
The shop (for now) sells only pants and shirts
There are two types of clothing, Vintage and
Modern. Each clothing contains a void printInfo
method which takes no parameters and prints a 
message of the type:
"A <Type> of <Clothes>"
It is worth noting that each clothing shop can 
sell only one of the clothing types, that means
that a Modern Shop cannot sell Vintage clothing
and vice versa.
