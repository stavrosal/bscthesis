We wish to develop a system that creates games.
There are 2 types of games (FPS, MMO) and each
game has 2 characters (Archer and Knight) where
each character has different weapons, for example,
Knight attacks with a sword and Archer attacks with
a bow. You don't need to model weapons, just print
a line of the following type:
"<Genre> <Character> attacks with <Weapon>"
Assume that each character behaves differently
depending on the game genre. We want to be able 
to create Games that have a lot of characters, 
but we don't want to mix different genres
(for example, an FPS Knight on an MMO game).
