We want to model Basket teams. Each team has a name
(string) and players with different roles. There are 3 roles:
 -defenders
 -attackers
 -forwarders
We want a functions that prints all players' names
(void), regardless of their role. We also want
3 functions (one for each role) that get a Player object
as a parameter and return True/False based on whether the
player is in the team or not (boolean). Assume that Player
class is implemented and that all 3 player roles extend this
class. Assume also that there is a getName() method.
