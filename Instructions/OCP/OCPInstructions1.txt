We want to model a system of food Stores. Each store
has a some products (Product) of different categories. 
Specifically there are 3 categories:
 -vegetables
 -fruits
 -dairy
We want a function that returns the total amount of items in 
store (int) and function that prints all items' names (void).
Assume there is a getName() getter in Product class. Also
assume that each object (Vegetable, Fruit, Dairy) extends
the abstract Product class.
