We want to model developers as Employees. Each employee has a name (String),
a notes field (String) and a position in the company (String). Each Employee
also works some pre-specified hours per week (int), has an age (int) and a
wage (double). There are 2 job statuses in the company, part-time if weeklyHours < 40,
and full-time otherwise. Wage is calculated monthly and is dependent on the position
(junior, mid-level, senior) and the total hours worked IN A MONTH. Juniors get 8€/hour,
mid-level get 10€/hour and seniors get 12€/hour. According to tax regulations (which
are specified by the government), there is a 36% wage tax, where the employee contributes
by 4% and the employer by 32%.
