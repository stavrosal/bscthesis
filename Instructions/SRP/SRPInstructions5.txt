We want to model Wedding events. Each wedding will take place in a venue (String)
and will have a List of people (assume People class is already implemented).
Each wedding has food catered to the attendants, where the total cost is calculated
by the catering company. Specifically, each person is entitled to one meal, which
costs 3€ if its basic, and 3.5€ if its vegan. If there are more than 500 attendants
then the prices are -1 / person (that means 2€/basic and 2.5€/vegans). The wedding also
has a photographer that is paid based on the attendants. The base price is 1€/person but
if there are more than 600 attendants then the price drops to 0.75€/person.
