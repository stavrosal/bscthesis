We want to model a system that stores vehicles.
All vehicles have some common attributes, like
VIN number (unique) (String) and engine size 
in cubic centimeters (cc) (int). There are
2 types of vehicles (Car and Truck) where the
type is saved in a String field. Each vehicle
can only move on a specific type of road. There
are 3 types of roads (Highway, rural, off-road).
Each vehicle has 2 actions (methods). The first 
one moves the vehicle (moveVehicle), and its a 
void method with no parameters that prints a message
of the following format:
"<Vehicle Type> is moving on <Road Type>"
There is also a horn method, which is void and also
takes no parameter and just prints a horn imitation
sound ("Beep!") for cars and a louder sound 
("BEEP BEEP!") for trucks.
